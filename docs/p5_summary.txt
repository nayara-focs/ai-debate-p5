Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) 2023 — Summary

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2023 P5 report sets a balanced, decade-scale strategy for US particle physics, framed by a
20‑year global vision and two budget scenarios. Its program design emphasizes (i) high discovery
potential across three themes—Decipher the Quantum Realm, Illuminate the Hidden Universe, and
Explore New Paradigms; (ii) a portfolio spanning small/mid/large projects so that science is delivered
continuously; (iii) strong coordination with international partners for shared facilities; and (iv) enabling
investments in workforce, R&D, software/computing, and sustainability. The plan (a) completes and
harvests ongoing experiments (HL‑LHC, DUNE/LBNF first phase, Rubin/LSST, DESI, SBN, Muon g‑2,
Mu2e, Belle II, LHCb, direct dark‑matter experiments), (b) constructs a set of priority facilities—CMB‑S4;
a re‑envisioned second phase of DUNE with ACE‑MIRT beam power and enhanced near/far detectors;
an offshore e⁺e⁻ Higgs factory with substantial US participation; a Generation‑3 (G3) direct‑detection
dark‑matter experiment reaching the “neutrino fog”; and IceCube‑Gen2—and (c) launches enabling R&D
toward a future ~10 TeV parton‑center‑of‑momentum (pCM) collider, with a muon‑collider demonstrator
as a key milestone. The plan also establishes a nimble small‑project line (ASTAE) and continues mid‑scale
opportunities through NSF programs. Workforce development, open science, and energy‑efficient
operations are treated as program requirements, not afterthoughts.

1. INTRODUCTION AND PROCESS
A community‑driven planning process grounded in Snowmass inputs and agency charge letters led
to a consensus prioritization that leverages US strengths while coordinating internationally. Criteria
included scientific impact, readiness and risk, cost realism, operations profile, and the broader health
of the field. Recommendations are robust to a baseline DOE‑HEP budget trajectory and adaptable to
tighter or more favorable paths through staged scope, decision gates, and international cost sharing.

2. THE RECOMMENDED US PROGRAM
2.1 Higgs‑factory participation and collider strategy
US participation in an offshore e⁺e⁻ Higgs factory is prioritized to achieve model‑independent Higgs
couplings, rare/exotic decay sensitivity, and precision electroweak studies. A collider panel evaluates
design options (e.g., circular vs linear), defines US deliverables (detectors, accelerators, software and
computing), and sets decision points aligned with international timelines. In parallel, enabling technology
R&D proceeds for future high‑energy colliders (high‑field magnets, SRF/cryogenics, advanced acceleration,
precision instrumentation), including a muon‑collider demonstrator on the path to ~10 TeV pCM.

2.2 Neutrino program (LBNF/DUNE and supporting facilities)
The long‑baseline program remains a centerpiece. The first phase delivers decisive mass ordering and
precision oscillation measurements using an intense wide‑band beam from Fermilab to far detectors (FD)
at SURF, with a capable near‑detector (ND) complex. A re‑envisioned second phase accelerates physics
through ACE‑MIRT (proton complex upgrades for sustained higher beam power), deployment of a third
far‑detector module (FD3), and a more powerful ND. An advanced FD4 remains an option contingent on
performance and budget. Tight integration of beamline monitoring, ND‑to‑FD extrapolation, calibration,
and theory inputs ensures that growing statistics translate into robust measurements and sensitivity to
beyond‑Standard‑Model (BSM) signatures (supernova neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, and baryon‑number
violation in the same apparatus).

2.3 Cosmic frontier: CMB‑S4, spectroscopic mapping, and high‑energy messengers
CMB‑S4 is endorsed as a next‑generation facility targeting inflationary B‑modes, neutrino properties
(sum of masses, effective relativistic species), and dark‑sector physics through precise polarization and
temperature maps. A follow‑on wide‑field spectroscopic survey (Spec‑S5) is developed to map structure
growth and dark energy with unprecedented systematics control. High‑energy neutrino and gamma‑ray
observatories (including IceCube‑Gen2) provide complementary “messengers” and enable multi‑messenger
astrophysics. Cross‑agency and international coordination are necessary for remote‑site operations and
long‑term calibration stability.

2.4 Dark matter: a comprehensive, multi‑probe program
A staged direct‑detection line culminates in a world‑leading G3 experiment, emphasizing radiopurity,
large target mass, and robust calibration/veto systems to reach the neutrino‑background floor. P5 leaves
open the option of a second, complementary G3 configuration (distinct target or readout) if resources and
partnerships allow. Accelerator‑based searches, sub‑GeV techniques, precision atomic/nuclear probes,
and novel sensors broaden coverage, while astrophysical and cosmological probes add orthogonal constraints.

2.5 Small‑ and mid‑scale projects portfolio
A vibrant small/mid portfolio preserves agility for novel ideas, de‑risks technologies, and provides
leadership opportunities for early‑career scientists. DOE’s new ASTAE line complements NSF’s MSRI/MRI
mechanisms, with dynamic selection against opportunity cost, impact, and synergy with the larger roadmap.

3. DECODE THE QUANTUM REALM (PRECISION AND COLLIDERS)
3.1 Higgs and electroweak precision
An e⁺e⁻ Higgs factory enables recoil‑based absolute couplings and rare/exotic decay searches. Large W/Z
samples support ultra‑precise electroweak tests; global fits integrate HL‑LHC and factory measurements.
Upgrades in detectors and software (precision timing, tracking, high‑granularity calorimetry, ML‑assisted
reconstruction) increase sensitivity, including for long‑lived particles.

3.2 QCD and flavour
Heavy‑flavour and jet studies probe CKM unitarity, CP violation, and rare processes as sensitive null tests.
Progress depends on higher‑order calculations, improved parton showers, and hadronization modeling,
matched to experimental precision. Timing and flavor‑tagging upgrades sharpen sensitivity to long‑lived
signatures and exotic topologies.

3.3 Theory and global interpretation
Sustained support for theory, phenomenology, lattice, and formal work is coupled to experimental
milestones. SMEFT‑based global fits and reinterpretation frameworks integrate collider, flavour, and
electroweak data with correlated systematics. Open data and public tools extend impact over decades.

4. ILLUMINATE THE HIDDEN UNIVERSE (DARK MATTER & COSMIC)
4.1 Direct and indirect searches
Generation‑2 WIMP experiments complete operations while a G3 facility with extreme backgrounds control
is prepared. Multiple technologies (including potential complementary G3) accelerate cross‑checks in the
event of a signal and create resilience against procurement risks. Accelerator‑based and sub‑GeV techniques,
precision atomic/nuclear probes, and low‑threshold sensors extend reach to light dark matter; indirect probes
(gamma‑rays, charged particles, neutrinos) are interpreted with careful astrophysical modeling.

4.2 Early universe and cosmic structure
CMB‑S4 anchors early‑universe tests and neutrino properties; Spec‑S5 maps late‑time structure to constrain
dark energy and growth history. Joint analyses across imaging, spectroscopy, and CMB datasets reduce
systematics. Survey operations rely on robust calibration strategies, foreground separation, and data‑quality
monitoring; shared infrastructure and long‑term logistics at remote sites are critical for success.

5. EXPLORE NEW PARADIGMS (ACCELERATORS & NEXT FACILITIES)
5.1 Targeted collider R&D and decision points
A collider panel reviews Higgs‑factory options abroad and sets US participation levels with clear down‑selections
and milestones. In parallel, enabling technologies for a future domestic collider are prioritized: high‑field magnets,
SRF, wakefield acceleration, precision beam instrumentation, and muon‑beam capabilities.

5.2 Muon‑collider demonstrator
A demonstrator program addresses high‑brightness muon production, rapid cooling, fast acceleration,
background mitigation, and the machine–detector interface. Successful milestones establish a credible path
to a ~10 TeV pCM machine and leverage laboratory strengths while retiring major technology risks.

5.3 Detector and instrumentation innovation
Priorities include precision timing, ultralow‑mass tracking, high‑granularity calorimetry, low‑threshold sensors,
radiation‑tolerant electronics, and advanced trigger/DAQ. Shared test‑beam infrastructure and common
software stacks accelerate development and improve sustainability across projects.

6. INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
6.1 Accelerator complex and test facilities
The US accelerator complex is sustained as a national asset for beams, test stands, and detector development.
Upgrades improve reliability and performance and are aligned with flagship timelines (notably DUNE). Test‑beam
capacity, target stations, and common R&D infrastructure are treated as enabling investments coordinated
across labs and universities.

6.2 Computing and software
Exabyte‑scale data motivate a federated architecture that combines on‑prem HPC with cloud resources.
Workflow orchestration manages heterogeneous back‑ends; reproducible pipelines carry provenance and
audit trails. Emphasis areas: ML‑accelerated reconstruction and simulation, robust/transparent algorithms,
FAIR‑by‑design data, open‑science practices, and durable preservation (data tiers, metadata, analysis recipes).

6.3 Theory and cross‑disciplinary links
Support for lattice, formal, and phenomenological theory is matched to experimental schedules. Partnerships
with applied math, computer science, and materials science accelerate algorithmic progress, ML robustness,
novel detectors, and advanced controls.

7. WORKFORCE, DIVERSITY, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
A technologically advanced, diverse workforce underpins delivery of the program. Recommended actions:
strategic traineeships, fellowships, and early‑career awards; inclusive recruitment and retention; mentoring and
clear promotion pathways; recognition for long‑term operations in detectors, accelerators, and software;
and support for distributed teams (including remote sites). Outreach and education amplify impact and
support long‑term facility operations.

8. BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS AND PHASING
Two DOE‑HEP scenarios anchor sequencing. The baseline sustains the core: timely delivery of ongoing
projects; CMB‑S4; G3 dark matter (first configuration); strong US participation in an offshore Higgs factory;
and decisive progress on DUNE with ACE‑MIRT, FD3, and ND upgrades (with an option for FD4). Under
tighter scenarios, impacts include reduced Higgs‑factory participation, deferral of ACE‑MIRT, curtailed ND
enhancements, and at most partial participation in a second G3 configuration. Operations and research
budgets are protected so that completed facilities deliver science and the workforce is retained.

9. RISK, GOVERNANCE, AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS
Technical, schedule, and programmatic risks are managed via staging, prototyping, industrialization paths,
and site coordination. Governance emphasizes clear decision gates, transparent cost/schedule tracking,
and early engagement with international partners through MoUs and in‑kind frameworks. The strategy is
explicitly global: offshore Higgs factory with shared leadership; DUNE as a US‑hosted international project;
and cosmic facilities that require inter‑agency and cross‑border cooperation. Computing/software roles and
long‑term operations responsibilities are distributed to align with partner strengths.

10. SUSTAINABILITY AND COMMUNITY VALUES
Energy‑efficient computing and facilities, low‑carbon materials and logistics, and site‑appropriate environmental
stewardship are treated as design constraints. Open science, reproducibility, and durable preservation are
policy‑level commitments. Safety, well‑being, and inclusive culture are first‑order requirements that constrain
design choices and schedules; success metrics include people and process outcomes in addition to physics.

11. IMPLEMENTATION OUTLOOK
Near‑term priorities: harvest ongoing investments; launch CMB‑S4 and the first G3 dark‑matter experiment;
re‑optimize and deliver DUNE with ACE‑MIRT and FD3 while scoping an advanced FD4; and organize the
collider panel to define US participation in a Higgs factory and set milestones for future colliders, including a
muon‑collider demonstrator. The portfolio remains adaptive: if budgets improve, add a second G3 detector,
expanded ND capability, and enhanced R&D; if budgets tighten, staged delivery protects core science and ops.

12. NEUTRINO PROGRAM DETAILS (LBNF/DUNE)
12.1 Physics goals and measurement strategy
DUNE targets decisive CP‑violation sensitivity, precision tests of the three‑flavor framework and matter effects,
and BSM sensitivity. The wide‑band beam and long baseline enable spectral analyses that disentangle the
CP phase, mass ordering, and matter‑induced asymmetries, with complementary information from appearance
and disappearance channels. Ancillary physics includes supernova burst neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos,
and searches for baryon‑number violation, leveraging LArTPC imaging and large fiducial mass.

12.2 Near‑detector and far‑detector integration
The ND complex provides flux determination, cross‑section measurements, and constraints on nuclear‑model
uncertainties; near–far extrapolation methods and shared reconstruction frameworks propagate these constraints
to the FD. Calibration plans define control samples, timing alignment, and light/charge‑response monitoring,
with regular validation runs to maintain stable response across upgrades. Unified software and common
datasets streamline systematics treatment and reinterpretation.

12.3 ACE‑MIRT and beam‑power roadmap
ACE‑MIRT upgrades the accelerator complex for higher sustained beam power with reliability compatible with
multi‑year campaigns. The roadmap coordinates target and horn systems, thermal management, remote handling,
and radiological protection, with contingency for component stress and procurement timelines. Performance gates
ensure incremental power translates into sensitivity gains rather than increased downtime or systematics.

12.4 Systematics and analysis strategy
Systematics control employs redundant approaches: ND measurements and beam monitoring; FD calibration with
well‑understood channels; interaction‑model constraints; and diversified analysis methods for cross‑validation.
Shared software stacks and documented analysis workflows facilitate reproducibility and long‑term preservation,
with provisions for open data as feasible.

12.5 International roles and operations model
DUNE is a US‑hosted international project with in‑kind and cash contributions, shared construction deliverables,
and long‑term operations responsibilities. Agreements specify commissioning roles, data access, authorship, and
computing/software responsibilities distributed to reflect partner strengths while maintaining a coherent analysis
ecosystem aligned with operations needs.

13. DARK‑MATTER PROGRAM DETAILS
13.1 G3 direct detection
The G3 facility emphasizes ultra‑low backgrounds via material selection and screening, cleanliness protocols,
and deep‑underground siting; scalable detector modules with robust calibration and veto systems; and sensitivity
to both spin‑independent and spin‑dependent interactions. Analysis frameworks anticipate solar and supernova
neutrino physics in the same apparatus and plan for background‑limited statistics in the “neutrino fog.”

13.2 Complementary technology option
A second G3 configuration remains possible, recognizing that distinct target media and readout technologies
provide orthogonal systematics. Multiple technologies also accelerate cross‑checks in the event of a candidate
signal and improve resilience to procurement and operations risk.

13.3 Broader search ecosystem
Accelerator‑based and sub‑GeV techniques, precision atomic/nuclear probes, and new sensor concepts
(including low‑threshold phonon or charge readout) extend reach to light dark matter and other scenarios beyond
classic WIMPs. Indirect searches are interpreted with careful astrophysical modeling and cross‑correlations with
cosmological datasets to reduce degeneracies.

14. COSMIC PROGRAM DETAILS
14.1 CMB‑S4
CMB‑S4 combines sensitivity, frequency coverage, and sky area to target inflationary B‑mode polarization,
constrain neutrino mass, and sharpen dark‑sector limits. Stable operations rely on robust cryogenics, calibration
sources, foreground separation strategies, and data‑quality monitoring. Long‑term planning for remote‑site
logistics, staffing, and infrastructure is essential to meet sensitivity and uptime goals.

14.2 Spec‑S5
The spectroscopic survey aims for high completeness, uniform target selection, precise fiber assignment,
and stable spectral calibration. Design choices prioritize systematics control critical to large‑scale‑structure
inference; cross‑correlations with imaging and CMB datasets deliver tighter cosmological constraints and
improved mitigation of observational artifacts and selection effects.

14.3 High‑energy messengers
Next‑generation neutrino and gamma‑ray facilities expand discovery space for transient and diffuse sources.
Coordinated observing campaigns and open‑data practices enable multi‑messenger analyses with shared
alert systems and community tools.
